The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven different layers. These layers help to understand how data is transferred over a network and how different devices communicate with each other. The seven layers of the OSI model are as follows:

Physical layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission of raw data.

Data link layer: Manages the flow of data between two directly connected nodes.

Network layer: Handles the routing of data packets from the source to the destination.

Transport layer: Ensures that data is delivered error-free and in the correct order.

Session layer: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices.

Presentation layer: Translates data into a format that can be understood by the application layer.

Application layer: Provides network services to the end-user applications.

The OSI model serves as a reference point for understanding network protocols and helps in troubleshooting network issues by providing a clear framework for communication between different devices.
