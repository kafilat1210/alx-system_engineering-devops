## Description
This project focuses on implementing HTTPS SSL termination using HAProxy on Ubuntu 16.04, ensuring secure and encrypted traffic for specified subdomains of a domain. It involves configuring DNS records, setting up HAProxy for SSL termination, and verifying functionality using curl commands.

---

## Project Tasks
1. **World wide web**
   * **Objective:** Configure DNS zone for specified subdomains and create a Bash script for auditing subdomain information.
   * **Script:** `0-world_wide_web`
   * **Example Output:**
     ```
     $ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online
     The subdomain www is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
     The subdomain lb-01 is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
     The subdomain web-01 is a A record and points to 34.198.248.145
     The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
     ```

2. **HAproxy SSL termination**
   * **Objective:** Configure HAProxy to terminate SSL traffic on port 443 for the subdomain www.
   * **Configuration File:** `1-haproxy_ssl_termination`
   * **Example Output:**
     ```
     $ curl https://www.holberton.online
     Holberton School for the win!
     ```
